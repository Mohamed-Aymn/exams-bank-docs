UX Design
===============

Sitemap
--------
As Exam Bank is a relatively mid-size website it will be so messy to 
go through the development process without creating sitemap for the 
application in User Experience design phase to have a context overview 
for website pages.

Wireframe
------------
Highly details UI UX design is out of the web development scoop, so 
creating a handwritten wireframe was fair enough and helped a lot in 
building imagination in real life.

.. note::
    Detailed desktop wireframe only is created.

    several wireframes are created due to the existence of several types of users.
